# Icon Assets for Goodloops Dev

This directory should contain the following icon assets for the Goodloops Dev extension:

- `icon.svg` - Main icon used in the VS Code marketplace and extension sidebar
- `icon.png` - PNG version of the main icon
- `robot_panel_dark.png` - Robot icon for dark theme
- `robot_panel_light.png` - Robot icon for light theme

## Creating Your Own Icons

You'll need to create your own icon assets to replace the original Cline icons. The icons should be visually distinct from the original Cline icons to avoid confusion.

### Icon Specifications

- `icon.svg` and `icon.png` should be square (recommended 128x128 pixels)
- `robot_panel_dark.png` and `robot_panel_light.png` should match the dimensions of the original files

You can use the original icons as a reference for size and style, but make sure your icons are visually distinct to avoid trademark issues.

## Important Note

Do not use the original Cline icons in your fork. Create your own icons to avoid any potential trademark or copyright issues.
